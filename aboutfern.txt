Fernanda: I am a senior at Freedom High School and I spent 7 weeks of my summer learning computer science at the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in Miami, FL.
        I love traveling and spending my free time volunteering, reading, hanging out with my friends and family, and watching movies and TV shows on Netflix. My junior year of high school
        was the most stressful year of my life, and lots of students can say the same. That is why we were so excited to dedicate the last two weeks of the program to make this website. 
        I would've never had the opportunity to be a part of Girls Who Code if I hadn't been on Instagram one day and saw their sponsored ad. It got me thinking of all the other
        students who miss out on wonderful opportunities simply because they weren't aware of them. One of the many great things this website offers is a list of internships and scholarships
        you can apply to so you don't miss out on something that may appeal to you. You have the power to create your own future, so I believe it's important to make the most of your high school years 
        pursuing something you're really passionate about while focusing on your studies as well. Strive to be the best you can be, but know your limits.
