            Welcome to highschool. A new frontier on the battlefield of education. The journey through this

            unholy mess will be arduous and you will want to give up but you must not. I'm just kidding.

            Highschool is only as hard as you make it. It's true that it may be harder for some than others but

            don't worry. You just need to find your way of getting along with the system. You need to change

            study habits or start to actually study. There are some things that you are definitely going to have

            to do to make sure you don't struggle through highschool. If you follow most of the instructions

            below then you will be cruising through highshool. If you don't and slack off, especially through

            your first two years, you are very likely to fail (unless you work really hard). It'll be like trying to

            swim through a sea filled with strong currents. You'll be pull down by the currents (your bad

            grades) and you'll have to fight your way to the surface. Eventually you get a cramp, you won't be

            able to fight back and you'll hit rock bottom.

            <h3>Freshmen</h3>
            <ul class="mini-pathway">

            <li>First off. DON'T SLACK OFF!!!!!. You should make sure you don't slack off all throughout

            highschool. However if you do it during freshmen you will have a really hard time bringing your

            GPA up later. You should use this year to map out what you're going to be doing during your next

            3 years of high school. You'll need to adjust so you can find the most efficient way of dealing with

            everything.</li>

            ­<li>Get all the school supplies you know you might need ahead of time. If you wait to the last

            minute you might not be able to find them. Besides, you don't wanto be known as the kid you

            didn't have anything on the first day and had to borrow a pencil and paper in every class.</li>

            ­<li>If necessary get a School map. It may sound to stupid but you're better off know ing where your

            classes are and how to get to them then being stranded in to school and having to ask others for

            directions.</li>

            ­<li>Make friends: having friends at school makes it easier to enjoy school. You don't have to feel

            pressured. Take all the time you need to make friends. </li>

            ­<li>Befriend the upperclassmen: These guys have been through what you're experiencing. They

            know how to deal with the teachers , the strategies to acing certain classes and just who to avoid.</li>

            ­<li>Don't obssess over popularity and your looks. Concentrate on getting your grades up instead

            worrying baout what people think and have to say about you. In the long run, they can't help you

            get in to college with thier opinions.</li>

            ­<li>Participate in class and ask questions. It help you understand and remember the material.</li>

            ­<li>Accept that you may lose friends during high school.</li>

            ­<li>Try to be respectful towards your teachers and peers.</li>

            ­ <li>Try signing up for extracurricular activities. This helps with you social life and college

            applications.</li>

            ­ <li>DON'T SKIP CLASS!!! Your not slick. If you teacher doesn't get to you frist, your bad grades will

            catch you slipping.</li>

            ­ <li>DO YOUR MAKE UP!!! If you missed class do your make up assignment even if your teacher

            doesnt grade. It will help you understand the material you missed.</li>

            ­ <li>IF YOU DON'T GYM, make sure you get rid of your P.E. (Physical Education) class during

            freshmen year and get rid of it.</li>

            ­ <li>Start saving for college.</li>

             <li>­Brush up on the skills you think would be useful to you.</li>

            ­ <li>DON’T FORGET!!! Take care of yourself.</li>

              ­ Make sure you don't take any class that you might not be able to handle. Know your strengths,

              weakness and limits. It keeps you from having classes thay are way over your head.</li>
