        <h2>Study Tips</h2>
            <p>Grades don't define us or measure our intelligence, but they do say something about our work ethic and intellectual abilities. 
                For some classes, we find that we may need to work much harder than we're used to. The case could be that we've never had to study very 
                much throughout the majority of our academic career, so when the time comes that we encounter a difficult course that requires our extensive time and energy, 
                we may have no idea how to even begin to prepare for upcoming quizzes or tests. That is why this site exists: to connect you with the absolute best advice out 
                there on how to study for your exams and ace them all. But here's the catch: you determine your own success. The amount of time you put into your studying will reflect in your results.</p>
            <p>Luckily, there are many blogs out there that take the time to offer dozens of tips on how to be more productive, manage your time better, and organize your notes. 
                Here, I will summarize the most important advice given and provide links for additional information.</p>
              
            
          
            <h3>How to Improve Your Study Habits:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li class="listz">Take Good Notes</li>
                        <p><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/" target="_blank">Studies</a> have shown that handwriting your notes beats typing your notes any day. With that being said, it's best to keep a notebook for each class. 
                        One of the best ways to make note-taking fun is to color code your notes. Choose a pen color for writing down the teacher's notes, and a different pen color for 
                        writing down things the teacher says in their lecture. This helps you tie the things you've read and the things you've heard so you can have a better understanding of the material. 
                        When studying for an upcoming test, review your notes, mark them with a highlighter, and make flashcards. Flashcards can be used for definitions of key words or questions of key points. 
                        Having someone quiz you with your flashcards will allow for better retention of the information.</p>
                    <li class="listz">Pace Yourself</li>
                        <p>You've heard it a million times and I'll tell you again. Do not wait until the night before to start studying for a big test. There are times where you'll get so caught
                            up in other things that studying the night before may be the inevitable resort, but if you're in danger of falling behind and you have a big test coming up, then pacing yourself
                            and beginning your study journey the week before would be your best option. Sometimes it's easy to start studying about a week before the test, and then fall behind because you thought 
                            you were getting ahead. Do not let this happen. Set a reminder for yourself to study every night for at least 30 minutes. You could even study during commercial breaks while watching
                            your favorite TV show. There's always at least a few minutes of free time in your busy day that you could use to study. Studying at the last minute can lead to so much stress. By pacing 
                            yourself and giving yourself additional days to study, you have a better chance of being comfortable and more familiar with the information you're studying.</p>
                    <li class="listz">Actually Do The Homework</li>
                        <p>In some classes, homework is a large part of the overall grade, and not doing a few assignments can harm your GPA more than you'd expect. While there are some teachers who give out homework simply as busy work,
                          there are times when homework assignments are useful. A lot of times, what you see on the homework ends up being the same material you will see on the test. Doing the homework often substitutes having to study extensively for a test because outside of class,
                          homework is usually the only place you can apply the material you've learned.</p>
                    <li class="listz">Take Some Practice Tests</li>
                        <p>The best way to make sure you completely understand the material and are ready for the actual test is to take a practice test, or at least do a few practice problems. This method especially works for classes in which
                          the teacher doesn't provide you with any homework or study guides. Taking practice tests is especially helpful when you're taking an AP class and you find that you need more practice. A good resource to use for practice questions
                          on AP, SAT, and ACT Tests is <a href="https://www.albert.io/" target="_blank">Albert.</a>
                        </p>
                   <li class="listz">Use a Planner or Calendar</li>
                        <p>Each year in high school is more stressful than the last. The amount of homework and tests you have piles up so much that sometimes you may forget that you have an upcoming test.
                           To avoid the "we have a test today!?" moment right before class begins, have a calendar hanging above the desk in your room or carry a planner. <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a>
                           is a useful resource as well, especially if your school has a digital cirriculum. Write down every important date-- test dates, due dates, and reminders for certain after-school commitments.</p>   
                    <li class="listz">Make To-Do Lists</li>
                        <p>Other than writing down reminders for important upcoming events, it's important to write down the things you have to do during the day. While it's easy to simply
                        jot down all that you have to do, getting everything on your list done is often the toughest part. Something that may help would be to plan out every hour of your day.
                        There's something satisfying about crossing off things on your to-do list, so being able to cross out all that you have completed within each hour may be extremely rewarding.
                        To encourage productivity and provide a sense of satisfaction throughout the day, I suggest getting <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en" target="_blank">Momentum,</a> 
                        a helpful chrome app that allows you to set your daily focus, track your to-dos, and inspire you with a daily photo and quote. </p>
                    <li class="listz">Prioritize</li>
                        <p>Going off of the statement above, make sure you do the most important things first and get them out of the way. A huge burden of stress will be lifted off your shoulders.
                        Try rewarding yourself after every important thing you get done. Also, remember to finish assignments with a closer due date first, then focus on getting the shortest assignments from
                        that list out of the way before you begin the more tedious assignments.</p>
                    <li class="listz">Find a Good Study Place</li>
                        <p>Sometimes working in your bedroom isn't the best idea. While it may be your most comfortable spot, it's easy for you to get distracted by your bed and have the sudden urge to crawl in and
                        go to sleep. However, if it seems to work for you, then go right ahead. Other areas of the house may be a better option if your house isn't really noisy. A lot of students prefer to do
                        their work in coffee shops or bookstores. A combination of the perfect volume of noise and the smell of coffee amongst other things creates an atmospere that inspires productivity.</p>
                    <li class="listz">Eliminate Distractions</li>
                        <p>We've all been there. Sometimes the studying gets so exhausting that we decide to check our phones for about 5-10 minutes and all of a sudden those few minutes
                        turn into an hour. The best thing to do is to just turn your phone off and keep it in a place where you won't be able to reach for it quickly. Instead of checking your phone
                        while you take your quick break, get a hold of that book you've been dying to read and read a few pages. These days, a lot of our work is done on a computer
                        and in that case, it may be easy to open a new tab and type in facebook.com. To avoid these kind of temptations, you can block distracting websites with this 
                        <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en" target="_blank">chrome app.</a> </p>
                    <li class="listz">Give Yourself A Break</li>
                        <p>Studying for long periods of time gets exhausting, as if the mere idea of studying doesn't want to make you go to sleep already.
                        When you study for too long, you get so mentally exhausted that you barely process the information you're taking in. That's why it's important
                        to back away from your work for a few minutes, get up, and get your blood flowing (especially if it's a walk to the fridge). 
                        It's okay to check your phone during breaks, but because it's so easy to lose track of time when you're on your phone,
                        it's important that you set a timer for the length of your break. When you're done with all that you're supposed to do, celebrate! Go out to eat,
                        get some ice cream, watch that movie or TV show you've been dying to see, spend time with your friends and family, and sleep for as long as you need.</p>
                    <li class="listz">Have a Snack (preferably a healthy one)</li>
                        <p>Eating while working is a great way to make your exhausting journey tolerable. The more you eat while you're studying, the better you feel. Any food works to keep you going, 
                        but remember, those calories still count. So if you're going to eat a lot to keep yourself productive, then you might as well eat something healthy. Fruit snacks are the best snacks.
                        If you're a coffee-drinker, just know that only a moderate amount should suffice.
                        </p>
                    <li class="listz">Sleep (no, not while you're studying)</li>
                        <p>Do not pull all-nighters. If you have a lot of things to do in a day, then start as soon as you can and work from there until about 10pm. If you 
                        weren't able to finish everything, then save that work for early morning. If it still isn't possible, then let this be a lesson to never procrastinate 
                        this bad again. Don't push yourself over your own limit. You are more important than all the assignments you have to do. Take care of yourself first.
                        Staying up all night for an assignment won't feel great the next day, and often times the final product of an all-nighter doesn't get you a good result anyway.
                        This is because our brains <a href="http://www.duqsm.com/sleep-is-not-for-the-weak-why-staying-up-late-is-bad-for-the-brain-and-body/" target="_blank">stop functioning the way 
                        they usually do after extensive periods of wakefulness.</a>
                        <a href="http://news.nd.edu/news/29625-learning-best-when-you-rest-sleeping-after-processing-new-info-most-effective-new-study-shows/" target="_blank">Studies</a> have also shown 
                        that sleeping after a period of studying allows you to remember the material more because your brain processes the information as you sleep.</p>
                    <li class="listz">Always Ask For Help When You Need It</li>
                        <p>One of the worst mistakes you can make is refuse to ask a teacher for help because they're too intimidating or you're too embarassed. These feelings of insecurity won't matter
                        in a year from now, so not to sound harsh, but get over it and ask for help. It's what they're paid to do. Don't let insecurity be the reason you don't pass a class.
                        It's your education, no one else's, so you need to do what's best for you always. If you don't understand the way a teacher is explaining a certain topic, then
                        ask them to break it down to the point where it sounds like they're teaching a second-grader. Believe me, you end up finding out a lot more than you would ever think.
                        Spending a lot of time after class with your teachers or professors for more clarification will always benefit you. If you still don't understand after that, then ask 
                        another student who understands the topic well. If you're totally lost in a certain class, hiring a tutor never hurts.</p>
                
                </ol>

        <h2>Writing Essays</h2>
            <p>Writing is so important. It may not seem like it now, but it has the power to determine your future-- especially when you're applying to college or a job. In fact, the importance of writing grows 
                even after you've gotten to college or work for your job. If writing isn't your strong suit now, you may want to start on enhancing your skills. Don't be discouraged, all it takes is practice. 
                It's important to plan your essays before you begin writing. Do this by making an outline, a flow chart, or whatever works for you. Don't spend too much time thinking of big words to use, especially 
                if you don't know what they mean. It's best to use your natural voice and clearly write what's on your mind and elaborate from there.</p>
